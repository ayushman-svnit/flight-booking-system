## 🎯 **SECTION 2: TECHNICAL QUESTIONS**

### Q4: Explain your database schema and relationships
**Answer:**
We have **6 main tables** with **5 key relationships:**

**Tables:**
1. **users** - Stores user accounts (customers & admins)
2. **airlines** - Airline companies information
3. **flights** - Flight schedules and details
4. **bookings** - User flight reservations
5. **payments** - Payment transactions
6. **audit_log** - Change tracking (for accountability)

**Relationships (Foreign Keys):**
1. `flights.created_by` → `users.user_id` (Admin creates flights)
2. `flights.airline_id` → `airlines.airline_id` (Flight belongs to airline)
3. `bookings.flight_id` → `flights.flight_id` (Booking for a flight)
4. `bookings.user_id` → `users.user_id` (User makes booking)
5. `payments.booking_id` → `bookings.booking_id` (Payment for booking)

**ER Diagram visualization available in documentation.**

---

### Q5: Is your database in BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)?
**Answer:**
Yes, all our tables are in **BCNF**:

**Example - Bookings Table:**
- Primary Key: `booking_id`
- All non-key attributes depend ONLY on `booking_id`
- No partial dependencies (all attributes fully depend on PK)
- No transitive dependencies (no attribute depends on non-key attribute)

**Verification:**
- Every determinant is a candidate key
- No redundant data
- Each table has a single responsibility
- Follows all normalization rules (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)

---

### Q6: Explain the triggers in your database
**Answer:**
We have **4 automated triggers:**

**1. audit_booking_changes**
```sql
Fires: AFTER UPDATE on bookings
Purpose: Tracks when booking status changes
Example: When booking cancelled → logs old/new status to audit_log
```

**2. update_available_seats_on_booking**
```sql
Fires: AFTER INSERT on bookings
Purpose: Automatically reduces available seats when booking confirmed
Example: Flight has 100 seats → User books → Now 99 seats
```

**3. restore_seats_on_cancellation**
```sql
Fires: AFTER UPDATE on bookings
Purpose: Returns seats when booking cancelled
Example: Booking cancelled → Adds seats back to flight
```

**4. validate_flight_capacity**
```sql
Fires: BEFORE INSERT on bookings
Purpose: Prevents overbooking
Example: If no seats available → Raises error, booking fails
```

**Why triggers?** Automation, data integrity, consistency, audit trail

---

### Q7: What are the database views you created?
**Answer:**
We have **3 complex views:**

**1. flight_revenue_summary**
```sql
Shows: Flight ID, revenue, bookings count, occupancy percentage
Use: Admin analytics - which flights are most profitable
```

**2. user_booking_history**
```sql
Shows: Complete booking details with user & flight info
Use: User dashboard - view all bookings with full details
```

**3. daily_flight_schedule**
```sql
Shows: Today's flight schedule with formatted times
Use: Display daily departures/arrivals
```

**Why views?** Complex queries simplified, better performance, reusability

---

### Q8: How does authentication work in your system?
**Answer:**

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Registration:**
   - User provides: username, email, password
   - Backend hashes password using **bcrypt** (cannot be reversed)
   - Stores hashed password in database

2. **Login:**
   - User enters username & password
   - Backend verifies password against hash
   - If correct → generates **JWT token** with user info
   - Token sent to frontend

3. **Protected Routes:**
   - Frontend stores token in localStorage
   - Every API request includes token in header
   - Backend verifies token before processing request
   - If invalid/expired → returns 401 Unauthorized

**Security Features:**
- Passwords never stored in plain text
- JWT tokens expire after 30 minutes
- HTTPS recommended for production
- CORS configured for specific origins

---

### Q9: Explain CRUD operations in your project
**Answer:**

**For Flights (Admin):**

**CREATE:**
```python
POST /flights
Admin adds new flight with details (number, route, time, price)
Validates data → Saves to database
```

**READ:**
```python
GET /flights
Retrieves all flights (with optional filters: source, destination, date)
Returns JSON array of flights
```

**UPDATE:**
```python
PUT /flights/{id}
Admin updates flight details (price, seats, time)
Validates → Updates database
```

**DELETE:**
```python
DELETE /flights/{id}
Admin removes flight
Cascading deletes related bookings (if configured)
```

**Same pattern for:** Airlines, Bookings, Users

---

### Q10: How do you handle errors and exceptions?
**Answer:**

**Backend (FastAPI):**
```python
# Example: Login error
if not user:
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=401,
        detail="Invalid credentials"
    )

# Example: Database error
try:
    db.commit()
except Exception as e:
    db.rollback()
    raise HTTPException(500, "Database error")
```

**Frontend (React):**
```javascript
try {
    const response = await axios.post('/login', data);
    // Success handling
} catch (error) {
    if (error.response?.status === 401) {
        setError("Invalid username or password");
    } else {
        setError("Server error. Please try again.");
    }
}
```

**User Feedback:**
- Toast notifications for success/error
- Error messages in forms
- Loading states during operations
- Graceful degradation

- Complex transactions
- Multi-server setup
- Production deployment

**Note:** Our code can easily switch to PostgreSQL by changing connection string!

---

### Q14: How do you ensure password security?
**Answer:**

**Password Security Measures:**

1. **Hashing with bcrypt:**
```python
# Never store plain text
password_hash = bcrypt.hash(plain_password)
```

2. **Salt automatically added** - Each password has unique salt
3. **One-way encryption** - Cannot reverse hash to get password
4. **Slow hashing** - Prevents brute force attacks
5. **Password validation** - Minimum requirements (can add)

**Additional measures:**
- JWT tokens expire (30 minutes)
- HTTPS in production
- No password in logs/error messages
- Secure password reset (can be added)

---

### Q15: How does your frontend communicate with backend?
**Answer:**

**Communication Flow:**

```javascript
// 1. Frontend makes HTTP request
const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:8000/login', {
    username: 'admin',
    password: 'admin123'
}, {
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
});

// 2. Backend processes request
@app.post("/login")
def login(user_data: UserLogin):
    # Validate credentials
    # Generate JWT token
    return {"access_token": token}

// 3. Frontend receives response
localStorage.setItem('token', response.data.access_token);

// 4. Subsequent requests include token
axios.get('http://localhost:8000/bookings', {
    headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    }
});
```

**Technologies:**
- **Axios** for HTTP requests
- **JSON** for data format
- **CORS** enabled for cross-origin
- **JWT** for authentication

---

## 🚀 **SECTION 4: FEATURES & FUNCTIONALITY**

### Q16: Walk me through the booking process
**Answer:**

**User Booking Flow:**

1. **Login** → User authenticates with credentials

2. **Search Flights:**
   - Enter: Source, Destination, Date
   - System filters flights from database
   - Shows available flights with details

3. **Select Flight:**
   - Click "Book Now" button
   - System checks seat availability

4. **Confirm Booking:**
   - Enter passenger count
   - System calculates total amount
   - Creates booking record

5. **Payment (Simulated):**
   - Select payment method
   - System updates booking status to "confirmed"
   - Generates PNR number

6. **Confirmation:**
   - Display booking details
   - Send confirmation (toast notification)
   - Update available seats via trigger

**Database Changes:**
- New row in `bookings` table
- New row in `payments` table
- Update `flights.available_seats` (trigger)
- Log in `audit_log` (trigger)

---

### Q17: How does booking cancellation work?
**Answer:**

**Cancellation Process:**

1. **User Action:**
   - Click "Cancel Booking" button
   - Confirmation modal appears

2. **Backend Processing:**
```python
# Update booking status
booking.booking_status = "cancelled"
booking.payment_status = "refunded"
db.commit()
```

3. **Automated Actions (Triggers):**
   - `restore_seats_on_cancellation` trigger fires
   - Adds seats back to flight
   - Logs cancellation in audit_log

4. **Frontend Update:**
   - Show success toast notification
   - Update booking list
   - Show "Cancelled" badge

**Why it's good:**
- Seats automatically restored
- Complete audit trail
- User-friendly confirmation
- Real-time updates

---

### Q18: What is the daily flight feature?
**Answer:**

**Daily Flights Concept:**
Instead of creating separate flight records for each day, admin can create ONE flight that operates daily.

**How it works:**

1. **Admin Creates Daily Flight:**
   - Sets `is_daily = True`
   - Stores time (not full datetime)
   - Example: Flight AI101 departs 10:00 AM every day

2. **User Books:**
   - Sees the daily flight
   - Selects specific travel date
   - System creates booking for that date

3. **Advantages:**
   - Less database records
   - Easier management
   - Realistic for regular routes
   - Reduces admin workload

**Implementation:**
```python
# Database fields
is_daily: Boolean
departure_time_only: String (HH:MM:SS)
travel_date: DateTime (in booking)
```

---

### Q19: How do you handle concurrent bookings?
**Answer:**

**Scenario:** Two users try to book last seat simultaneously

**Solution - Database Triggers:**

1. **validate_flight_capacity** trigger checks BEFORE insert
2. Uses database-level locking
3. First request locks the row
4. Decrements available_seats
5. Second request sees 0 seats → Fails

**Code Protection:**
```python
# Atomic operation
if flight.available_seats >= booking.passengers_count:
    flight.available_seats -= booking.passengers_count
else:
    raise HTTPException(400, "Not enough seats")
```

**Why it works:**
- Database transactions ensure consistency
- Triggers execute in sequence
- No race conditions
- Data integrity maintained

---

### Q20: What analytics does admin dashboard provide?
**Answer:**

**Admin Analytics Features:**

1. **Flight Performance:**
   - Total bookings per flight
   - Revenue generated
   - Occupancy percentage
   - Uses: `flight_revenue_summary` view

2. **Booking Statistics:**
   - Total bookings (confirmed, pending, cancelled)
   - Revenue trends
   - Popular routes

3. **Real-time Data:**
   - Available seats

```sql
-- New table
CREATE TABLE seats (
    seat_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    flight_id INTEGER,
    seat_number VARCHAR(5),  -- e.g., "12A"
    seat_type VARCHAR(20),   -- economy/business/first
    is_available BOOLEAN,
    FOREIGN KEY (flight_id) REFERENCES flights(flight_id)
);

-- Update bookings
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN seat_ids TEXT;  -- JSON array
```

**2. Frontend:**
- Show seat map (grid layout)
- Available seats: green, Booked: gray
- Click to select
- Visual feedback

**3. Backend:**
```python
@app.post("/bookings/with-seats")
def create_booking_with_seats(
    flight_id: int,
    seat_numbers: List[str],
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
):
    # Check all seats available
    # Create booking
    # Mark seats as booked
    # Return confirmation
```

**Why not implemented:**
- Time constraints
- Adds complexity
- Core functionality complete
- Can be future enhancement

### Q35: How would you add payment gateway integration?
**Answer:**

**Payment Integration Strategy:**

**1. Choose Provider:**
- Razorpay (India)
- Stripe (International)
- PayPal

**2. Implementation:**
```python
# Backend
import razorpay

@app.post("/payment/create")
def create_payment(amount: float):
    client = razorpay.Client(auth=(KEY_ID, KEY_SECRET))
    
    order = client.order.create({
        "amount": amount * 100,  # paise
        "currency": "INR",
        "payment_capture": 1
    })
    
    return order

@app.post("/payment/verify")
def verify_payment(payment_id: str, order_id: str):
    # Verify signature
    # Update booking status
    # Send confirmation email
```

**3. Frontend:**
```jsx
// Razorpay checkout
const options = {
    key: RAZORPAY_KEY,
    amount: totalAmount * 100,
    order_id: orderId,
    handler: function(response) {
        // Verify payment
        // Update UI
    }
};
const rzp = new Razorpay(options);
rzp.open();
```

**Current Implementation:**
- Simulated payment
- Ready for real gateway
- Just need to add API keys

### Q36: What about email notifications?
**Answer:**

**Email Notification Implementation:**

**1. Setup:**
```python
# Install
pip install fastapi-mail

# Configure
from fastapi_mail import FastMail, MessageSchema

conf = ConnectionConfig(
    MAIL_USERNAME="your@email.com",
    MAIL_PASSWORD="password",
    MAIL_FROM="noreply@flightbooking.com",
    MAIL_PORT=587,
    MAIL_SERVER="smtp.gmail.com"
)
```

**2. Send Email:**
```python
async def send_booking_confirmation(booking: Booking):
    message = MessageSchema(
        subject="Booking Confirmed",
        recipients=[user.email],
        body=f"""
        Dear {user.first_name},
        
        Your booking is confirmed!
        PNR: {booking.pnr_number}
        Flight: {flight.flight_number}
        Date: {booking.travel_date}
        
        Happy Flying!
        """,
        subtype="html"
    )
    
    fm = FastMail(conf)
    await fm.send_message(message)
```

**3. Triggers:**
- Booking confirmed → Confirmation email
- Booking cancelled → Cancellation email
- 24 hours before flight → Reminder email

**Why not implemented:**
- Requires SMTP credentials
- Can be added easily
- Core functionality works without it

### Q37: How would you add flight tracking?
**Answer:**

**Flight Tracking Feature:**

**1. Database:**
```python
class FlightStatus(Base):
    __tablename__ = "flight_status"
    
    status_id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    flight_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("flights.flight_id"))
    current_location = Column(String(100))
    estimated_arrival = Column(DateTime)
    delay_minutes = Column(Integer, default=0)
    last_updated = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
```

**2. API Integration:**
- Use **FlightAware API** or **AviationStack**
- Get real-time flight data
- Update every 5 minutes

**3. Frontend:**
```jsx
// Real-time tracking
<FlightMap flightId={flightId} />
<FlightStatus>
    Current: {location}
    ETA: {estimatedArrival}
    Status: {status}
</FlightStatus>
```

**4. WebSocket for Real-time:**
```python
# Backend
@app.websocket("/ws/flight/{flight_id}")
async def flight_status_websocket(websocket: WebSocket):
    await websocket.accept()
    while True:
        status = get_current_status(flight_id)
        await websocket.send_json(status)
        await asyncio.sleep(10)
```
